    <p>
        Sinigang is a classic Filipino soup characterized by its sour and savory medley of flavors. <br>It's popular comfort food in the Philippines,  usually served on its own or paired with steamed <br> rice on rainy days to ward off the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like adobo, the term sinigang describes a cooking method more than a particular dish, as it has many variations. <br>It can be made with protein such as pork, fish, shrimp, beef, and chicken and souring agents such as tamarind, <br>guava, green mango, calamansi, kamias, batuan, santol, and other native fruits.
